# Capstone Project - Predictive Maintainance using Real Time Data Analytics 
Synopsis :
--------

This is the project about creation of real time data analytics platform for predictive maintaince. I have just followed lambda architecture but as I am using Apache spark there is no need of the most of the components in 3 different layers of the lambada architecure which are batch layer, speed layer and serving layer. With the help of Hadoop, Apche spark , MongoDB, Apache Kafka, I have created this architecture.Using Flask architecture of python to create REST based APIâ€™s which will just predict the values for given feature set.
